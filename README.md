# RatRig-V-Core-4-panel-drilling-jigs

This is a fully open source project, just as the printer, to help anyone drill their own V Core 4 panels.
They can get quite expensive, and having the possibility to buy plain rectangles then drill them out yourself is quite a money saver.
Bear in mind that you need to be at least handy with DIY since you risk ruining or breaking your panel.
The jigs can be used to mark out the holes, or clamped and drill through them (which I not recommend doing).
All files are .step, so you're more than welcome to make your own version, to improve it and to add new models.
I don't do this for work so this takes a lot of time out of my spare one, so I try to do as much as I can, but for now only 400 size is available, and not even all panels. By the end of this week (05/05/2024) I should be able to finish all 400 panels, then start working on the other sizes.
Thank you everyone and enjoy your V-Core!
